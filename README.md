# P05-mini

Funny project to put on an artificial mask in real-time.

### Objective
The initial purpose was to make an classifier of type of masks, but because there are lot of projets about it, I left as just a filter.

### Solution
Almost all the code belongs to [MaskeTheFace](https://github.com/aqeelanwar/MaskTheFace). I modified some functions in order to be able to run in real-time using the webcam.
